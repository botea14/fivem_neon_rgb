# fivem_neon_rgb
Turn ON Neon's for current car to a Random RGB color!

Created for my FiveM DriftV Server:

DriftV Discord- https://newb.lol/discord

Server Link: https://servers.fivem.net/servers/detail/dx53eq

Don't know how to add much details!

Short description: Will turn ON Random RGB color for neons in current car (if car allows it...) and will change to another random rgb color every keypress.

It should also turn on headlights, if they are not already turned ON.

Key HOME -- change in cl_neon.lua if you want to set it to other key (last row)

Works also with /neon chat command.


BUGS:
-passager is able to change color (visible only for passager)
-car will keep neons and headlights turned on after player leaves it.
-maybe others...
